# CAG_Restaurant

This project contains the backend API and frontend UI for the CAG Restaurant application.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally, follow these steps. These scripts should be run from the root of the `CAG_Restaurant` directory.

### 1. Set Up the Environment

This script prepares your environment by setting up the necessary dependencies.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Run the API

This script starts the backend FastAPI server. Make sure this is running before you start the frontend.

```bash
./run_api.sh
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Start the Frontend UI

This script launches the Next.js frontend application.

```bash
./start_full_stack.sh
```

You can now access the application in your browser, likely at `http://localhost:3000`.
